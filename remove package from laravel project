to remove a package from Laravel using PHP Composer?


    1. Remove declaration from file composer.json (in the "require" section)
    2. Remove any class aliases from file app.php
    3. Remove any references to the package from my code :-)
    4. Run composer update
    5. Run composer dump-autoload
