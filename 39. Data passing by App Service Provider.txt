when same query is written in several function in a controller, then 
software execution time getting increase

if we want we can create query ontime and share it to all view function

Step:1  Go to app->Providers->AppServiceProvider.php

	use Illuminate\Support\Facades\view;
	use app\Category;

	public function boot()
	{
		View::share('Categories', Category::where('status',1)->get());
	}

Step:2 commenting

	in controller, comment all the category query that are same as written in "AppServiceProvider"
	//$categories = Category::where('status',1)->get();
